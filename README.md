# lorenz-parametric-perturbations
The Lorenz system is an example of a dynamical system where a system of deterministic equations generates a system that evolves in an unpredictable way, because very small variations in the initial conditions amplify through time to a degree that, to have perfect knowledge of the future, one should have an infinitely precice knowledge of the initial conditions.
This kind of systems are called "chaotic systems" for their upredictable behavior.

This project is inspired by the paper "Controlling chaos with periodic parametric perturbations in Lorenz system".
The concept of the paper is to "control" the lorenz system by periodic parametric perturbations, obtaining a predictable periodic behavior of the system.

This project is a p5.js graphical implementation of the 2d projection of the lorenz system with the ability of the user to manually control the parametric perturbation moving the mouse over the graph.
This is ment to experiment with the manual control of chaos.

Note: the code has been written with the aid of llms.
